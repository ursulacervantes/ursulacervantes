### Oh hello!

I’m Ursula. A gal who wants to create awesome stuff✨

A problem solver and allround senior web engineer with good knowledge of front-end techniques. I love algorithms, data structure and I also stand for quality.

I believe in nudging things forward — thoughtfully and intentionally. Asking ‘what if’ as often as possible, constantly challenging standards, and experimenting endlessly.
