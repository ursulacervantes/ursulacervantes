### Oh hello! 👋🏽

I’m Ursula. A gal who wants to create awesome stuff✨

A problem solver and allround senior web engineer 👩🏽‍💻 with good knowledge of front-end techniques. I love algorithms, data structure and I also stand for quality.

I believe in nudging things forward — thoughtfully and intentionally. Asking 💭 ‘what if’ as often as possible, constantly challenging standards, and 👩🏽‍🔬experimenting endlessly.
